so here example code and dataset for few machine algorithm's
IN lane detection 
- lane1.py for lane detection in video file
- lane.py for lane detection in image file
- intellane.py for intel real sensor depth camera (it would work with you iam still working on it)
architecture floder : architecture folder have arch1.py which is neural network 
input layer -1(neuros)
output put layer -1(neurons)
hidden layer 1 -(2 neurons)
hidden layer 2 -(3 neurons)
it was working for 1 and 0 when it is used for 2 it is getting saturated
